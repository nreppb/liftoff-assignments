## Submission Instructions

### Overview

My Liftoff project idea is to create a website where users can easily find fitness classes related to their interests in their area. The user will be able to see how much said fitness class cost, the description of the class, what times/days they are offered and be able to link to the specific gym's website for membership costs. The idea for this came from me really enjoying a cardio karate class at UMSL years ago and then our instructor moved. It has been extremely hard for me to find another class because I find it tiring to look through each gym's website to figure out how much they cost and how far away the classes are. I would love for all of that information to be in one spot, as some of my best memories are working out in that group setting. I also want to show my family and friends what they can get into in the St. Louis area that they didn't even know existed!

### Features

User login: Users can save classes they are interested in and want to try, or have tried with a space for notes on what they thought of the class.

Search: Users will be able to search for fitness classes by location, keyword, and class price.

Add class time to their calendar: If a class is interesting, they can add the time and information on that class to their gmail or apple calendar.

List classes: The user will be able to list all or from the search, classes with the name, pictures, location, times, price of class, price of membership and a link to the gym's membership website.

Contact us: If you are a fitness instructor and would like your information added onto our website or changed, you can fill out a form and it will email the owner of the website directly.

Share class with someone else: A user should be able to share the link easily on social media platforms
